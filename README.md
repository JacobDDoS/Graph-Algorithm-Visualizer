# Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is another visualizer on my resume. This one visualizes different graph algorithms, although it currently only has 1 algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Skills used
* React
  * React Range Step Input
  * React Flow Renderer
* CSS
* Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's)

This project was a fun way to explore React and different graph algorithms. I'm also quite proud of it because there aren't other graph visualizers like this one (to my knowledge) so it is certainly unique and I had little to no reference but I still did it.
